# Kaggle Competition Notebooks

Welcome to the repository for my Kaggle competition notebooks. This repository contains the code and solutions I've developed for various Kaggle competitions. Each notebook is designed to showcase data analysis, model development, and experimentation for different challenges.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!

## Competitions

This repository is specifically for competitions I have participated in on Kaggle. Each notebook is linked to a specific competition and contains the steps I took to solve the problem at hand.

1. [Competition 1: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
2. [Competition 2: House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
3. [Competition 3: Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)
4. [Competition 4: Blood Glucose Level Prediction](#) (https://www.kaggle.com/code/jantine/brist1d-lstm-cnn-lstm-transformer-pytorch)
  
For each competition, I have followed the process of exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and submission to the competition.

## Notebooks

The notebooks in this repository include my work from data exploration to model optimization. Each notebook is self-contained and structured to be understandable.

   - Overview: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and first model training.
   - Topics covered: Data cleaning, visualizations, and baseline model.
   
2. **`2_Feature_Engineering_and_Optimization.ipynb`**  
   - Overview: Feature engineering and model optimization.
   - Topics covered: Advanced feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation.
   
3. **`3_Ensemble_and_Submission.ipynb`**  
   - Overview: Model ensembling and final submission.
   - Topics covered: Stacking models, ensemble techniques, final submission to Kaggle.

4. **`4_Model_Diagnostics_and_Future_Improvement.ipynb`**  
   - Overview: Model diagnostics and exploring future improvements.
   - Topics covered: Evaluating model performance, error analysis, and ideas for future enhancements.
